# Exploratory Data Analysis on Car Dataset 🚗📊

## 📌 Overview
This project performs detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car dataset to uncover key insights about pricing, fuel types, brand trends, and car specifications. It helps understand how different factors influence car prices.

## 💡 Objectives
- Analyze car data to identify important trends
- Visualize relationships between price and other features
- Understand how brand, fuel type, and engine size impact value

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains the following key attributes:
- Car Name / Brand
- Year
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Engine Capacity
- Mileage
- Price

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 File Structure
- `car_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with all EDA steps
- `car_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 📈 Insights Generated
- Price trends across different fuel types and brands
- Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots
- Average price comparisons between manual and automatic cars
- Impact of mileage and engine on pricing
